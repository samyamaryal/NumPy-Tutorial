# NumPy-Tutorial
Repo containing the code I used while conducting a training session on Numpy in college.
I made the ipynb file using Google Colab because I found it easier to illustrate examples in it.

The topics I covered are: 
- Basics of Numpy array
- Shapes and Dimensions of Numpy array
- Indexing an array
- Slicing an array
- Iterating through an array
- Sorting an array
- Searching for elements in an array
- Copying & Creating views for an array
- Filtering an array
- Joining multiple arrays
